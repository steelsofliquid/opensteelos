# OpenSteel/OS
OpenSteel/OS is an operating system based off of the Write Your Own Operating System tutorial with a few extra things added in. This is currently a re-organized Nanami/OS, but that is subject to change in the future.
Source code to be added as soon as a working build with a more organized strcture is made!

What OpenSteel/OS changes:
 - Organization of code
 - A more lenient roadmap
